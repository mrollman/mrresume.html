<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 28 years old living in Eagle Mountain, Utah. I grew up in West Jordan, Utah and have lived in Utah almost my entire life.
  I play basketball, golf, tennis, bowling, football, pickleball, and I also ski. I love going to sporting events such as BYU Football games
  or BYU basketball games.

<p>I am married to my wife Karina. We have no kids but have 2 dogs. Milo is a 4 year old golden retreiver, and cooper is an 18 week old Golden Doodle.
  I grew up in a family of 5, I have 1 brother and 1 sister.

<p>I'm tired of working random jobs and want to get into a career that i can be successful in, but can also grow and learn.
  I have a little schooling in IT and Cybersecurity, but I didn't want that to be the only part of my career. I'm hoping learning to code is 
  where i can find my passion and build a career.
